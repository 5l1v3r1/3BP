# Three Body Problem

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ullaakut/3BP/master/3BP.gif" width="100%"/></p>

## This is a work in progress

The goal of this project is to solve and render the orbits of three bodies in two dimensions in a terminal.

## How to test it?

* `get -u "github.com/nsf/termbox-go"`
* `git clone git@github.com:ullaakut/3BP`

## What is there left to do?

* [ ] Fix calculus. Currently using the parameters of the [Butterfly I configuration](http://three-body.ipb.ac.rs/sol.php?id=2) doesn't make the appropriate result. I think I got the equations incorrectly, and bodies are apparently not attracted to each other at the moment.
* [ ] Add interface to select configurations
* [ ] Add interface to manually change configuration
* [ ] Improve UI
